            <div class="info-box">Have you ever asked ChatGPT a question and been given a series of well-thought-out, convincing statements about a topic that, upon further investigation, were completely false? You’ve just witnessed what computer scientists call ‘hallucinations’ within generative Artificial Intelligence, or AI. Because the neural networks of AI like ChatGPT cannot separate fact from fiction, it may serve false statements for what it thinks is correct, then cite a nonexistent source to back up its claim. </div>
            <div class="info-box">ChatGPT is an LLM, or Large Language Model chatbot, trained on billions of documents, articles, webpages, and everything else across the internet and beyond, using the knowledge it has read through to create convincing human language. However, because these tools are trained on huge databases that reach all across the internet, not all of its information can be properly vetted.</div>
            <div class="info-box">Its tendency to create false information can be abused by those with malicious intent to fabricate and spread disinformation with ease and affordability. The tool’s wide database of unreliable and potentially dangerous sources render it susceptible to exploitation. With minimal effort, bad actors can harness this tool to churn out convincing yet utterly false narratives at an alarming scale.</div>

            <div class="info-box">AI tools like ChatGPT are constantly evolving, but as of now, are far from perfect. It’s important that when you use these tools, you should be doing so responsibly. Make sure that you double check the information that you get from the AI, and that you keep an eye out for what others say on the internet to keep misinformation in check.
